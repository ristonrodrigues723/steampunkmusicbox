This is steampunk retro-themed music speaker box. It lets you use an SD card to play songs without BLE, but using BLE is also possible to play songs via phones and other devices. It supports both local song playback and BLE streaming.
You use the rotary encoders to do everything you need from pausing, playing next-previous songs, to volume control. Everything will be done via knobs or BLE. Its CAD is good but not finished yet—it’ll take 15 more hours on top of the 20–23 hours already spent on project the code is simple ill needo iterate till i get what i want.

It auses NeoPixel LEDs that light up in patterns along with the song. I did this because I wanted a project where I could use my creative skills.
Total cost: $68 (including PCB and printing, Legion postage). It’s 65 actually ,$3 extra is because if stuff goes out of stock and you buy a single item later, there’s a delivery fee of around a dollar in India. i know this sucks

I'll be painting it using metallic colors to match the retro-steampunk theme—copper and golden colors for everything. I’ll use 3D-printed diffusers, fake faux tubes, and common anodes to give the vibe—actual nixie tubes and glass tubes are too expensive.
I'll work on the model the 3d cad  until I’m satisfied with what i have in mind.


i want oit to actually remind what i can do using both creativity and logic
