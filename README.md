# steampunkmusicbox
this is steam punk retor theamed music speaker box, lets u use sd card to play song without ble, but using ble is alsopossible to play songs via phones other devices it has suppoert for local song and ble streaming, u use the rotatgory encoders to do everything u need from pausing , to playing next prev song to vol control evertything will be done via knobs or ble, its cad is good but not finished yet itll take 15 hrs more on top of 20-23 hrs already spant it also uses neopixel leds thses lifght up in pattern alomg the song, i did this as i wanted a project where i use my creative skills 
total cost-65 including pcb and printing legion postage its 61 actually 4 is because if stuff goes out of stock and them u buya single item later there a dollar worth of dilevery fee in india .
ill be paintinh it using metallic colors to actually paint it retro-steampunk theme copper and golden cilors weverything use 3d printed diffusers fake faux tubes, common anodes to give the vibe actaul nixie tubes and the glastubes are too expensive, wil worjk on the model till im satiesfied


i want oit to actually remind what i can do using both creativity and logic
